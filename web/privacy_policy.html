        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Mongolian Drafts ("the App"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>This App is primarily an offline drafting application, and we collect very limited information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Draft Content</strong>: The text content of drafts you create and edit in this App, which is stored locally on your device only.</li>
            <li><strong>Tag Information</strong>: Tags you create for your drafts to organize and categorize them.</li>
            <li><strong>App Preferences</strong>: Your theme settings, font preferences, and other app configuration information, stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: To provide app functionality, we may collect basic device information (such as device model, operating system version), which is used only for app functionality optimization and not for identifying you.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Connection Status</strong>: The app may check network connection status to provide corresponding features, but does not collect or transmit your network activity data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and improve core app features (draft editing, tag management, search, etc.)</li>
            <li>To save your app preference settings</li>
            <li>To optimize app performance and user experience</li>
            <li>To diagnose and resolve technical issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All your draft content, tags, and app settings are stored in a local database on your device. We do not upload your draft content to any server or third-party service. All data remains on your device unless you actively delete it.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable technical measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is stored locally on your device and does not involve network transmission</li>
            <li>Your draft content is stored in an encrypted local database</li>
            <li>We follow security best practices provided by the operating system</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or rent your personal information or draft content to third parties. Your data belongs entirely to you, and we do not access or collect your draft content.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This App may use the following third-party services to provide functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flutter Framework</strong>: Used for app development, may collect anonymous usage statistics</li>
            <li><strong>System Services</strong>: Uses services provided by the operating system (such as file system, network status checks, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The use of these services is subject to their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can view, edit, or delete your draft content at any time</li>
            <li>You can delete the app at any time, which will delete all locally stored data</li>
            <li>You can change app preference settings at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This App is not directed to children under the age of 4. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will delete such information.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be notified to you through app updates or on this page. We recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of any updates.</p>
